# deep-learning-for-lung-sound-analysis

The code is created for lung sound recognition based on the Pytorch, Librosa [1], and pyaudioanalysis [2], It modularizes the operation of preprocessing, feature extraction, dataset splitting and classifier training.

For a specific example, the ICBHI 2017 dataset [3] is used as an example

Call order: Preprocessing -> Feature extraction -> Dataset splitting -> Classifier train and test.
