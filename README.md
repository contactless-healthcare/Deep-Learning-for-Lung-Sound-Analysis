# deep-learning-for-lung-sound-analysis

This is code repository for the paper "Deep learning in wireless stethoscope-based lung sound analysis".

It is developed for lung sound recognition based on the Pytorch, Librosa [1], and pyaudioanalysis [2], 
It modularizes the operation of deep learning, including the preprocessing, feature extraction, dataset splitting and classifier training.


For the demonstration, we uses ICBHI 2017 dataset as the example. 

There are six major .py files in this repo.

  1. Config.py: It controls the required parameters in each process.
  2. Preprocessing.py: It contains the basic noise reduction functions and data segmentation.
  3. Feature extraction.py: It transforms the lung sound signal into an input suitable for the model, such as statistical features and spectrogram.
  4. Data splitting.py: It divided the whole dataset into training and testing sets (in the subject-wise way).
  5. Classifier_training_and_testing: It is used to train and test the model.
  6. Model.deep learning.py: It stores the definitions of the model and the training and testing procedures.


To build a model for lung sound analysis, the 2-5 .py files should be performed sequentially, 
and the Config.py and Model.deep learning.py is applied for custom Settings.
